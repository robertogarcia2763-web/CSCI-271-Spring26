/*
Reflection:
1. What I understood from this program:
 (Explain the concept in your own words.)
 The program uses a for loop uses unsigned int i as a counter. When it reaches ten, it stops.

2. Difficulties I faced:
 (Syntax, logic errors, infinite loops, casting issues, etc.)
understanding unsigned int.

3. What I needed to search or review:
 (Documentation, examples, lecture slides, etc.)
 unsigned int and ++i

4. AI Usage (if any):
 - Did you use AI tools? If yes, explain how.
 - Did you verify the output?
none!

5. What I learned:
 (Be specific about loops, counters, casting, etc.)
 what unsigned int does and when and how to use it. I learned that ++i and i++ are the same.
