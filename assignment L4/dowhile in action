/*
Reflection:
1. What I understood from this program:
 (Explain the concept in your own words.)
the program uses a while loop and it counts from ten and while x is less than or equal to 5,
it will print x and add 1 to x. 

2. Difficulties I faced:
 (Syntax, logic errors, infinite loops, casting issues, etc.)
none!

3. What I needed to search or review:
 (Documentation, examples, lecture slides, etc.)
 nothing.


4. AI Usage (if any):
 - Did you use AI tools? If yes, explain how.
 - Did you verify the output?
none!

5. What I learned:
 (Be specific about loops, counters, casting, etc.)
I learned the "do" statement.
