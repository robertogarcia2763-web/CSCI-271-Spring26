/*
Reflection:
1. What I understood from this program:
 (Explain the concept in your own words.)
I understood the difference from counter and accumulator.
 A counter adds one, while an accumulator adds many.

2. Difficulties I faced:
 (Syntax, logic errors, infinite loops, casting issues, etc.)
using the for loop was a bit difficult at first because of the int i = 1...
all of the different parts of the for loop confused me.

3. What I needed to search or review:
 (Documentation, examples, lecture slides, etc.)
nothing.

4. AI Usage (if any):
 - Did you use AI tools? If yes, explain how.
 - Did you verify the output?
none!

5. What I learned:
 (Be specific about loops, counters, casting, etc.)
I learned how to read code better.
