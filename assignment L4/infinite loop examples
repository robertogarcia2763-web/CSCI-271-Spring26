/*
Reflection:
1. What I understood from this program:
 (Explain the concept in your own words.)
the programs are both examples of infinite loops. x is set to 1, and the loop asks if 1 is less than or equal to 5. 
the first program does not update the value of x, so the loop will run forever. 
the second program updates the value of x, so it will stop when x is greater than 5.

2. Difficulties I faced:
 (Syntax, logic errors, infinite loops, casting issues, etc.)
the only difficulty I faced was trying to write out what the code does, I understood it, but trying to put it into words was difficult.

3. What I needed to search or review:
 (Documentation, examples, lecture slides, etc.)
 nothing.


4. AI Usage (if any):
 - Did you use AI tools? If yes, explain how.
 - Did you verify the output?
none!

5. What I learned:
 (Be specific about loops, counters, casting, etc.)
 I learned how to get better at explaining code with words.
