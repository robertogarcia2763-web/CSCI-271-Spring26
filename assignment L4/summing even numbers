#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main(){
    int sum = 0;

    for (int i = 2; i <= 20; i += 2){
        sum += i; // adds even numbers: 2,4,6 8 and so on.

/*
Reflection:
1. What I understood from this program:
 (Explain the concept in your own words.)
the program uses a for loop and counts even numbers given by i += 2. it adds the even numbers to the sum variable and gives the sum.

2. Difficulties I faced:
 (Syntax, logic errors, infinite loops, casting issues, etc.)
 Compiler errors. I had to modify my tasks.json file. I am using visual studio code.
none!

3. What I needed to search or review:
 (Documentation, examples, lecture slides, etc.)
 nothing.


4. AI Usage (if any):
 - Did you use AI tools? If yes, explain how.
 - Did you verify the output?
none!

5. What I learned:
 (Be specific about loops, counters, casting, etc.)
I learned how to use a for loop to sum even numbers. */
