/*
Reflection:
1. What I understood from this program:
 (Explain the concept in your own words.)
Enters grades and calculates the average. When -1 is entered, the program stops asking for grades and calculates the average.

2. Difficulties I faced:
 (Syntax, logic errors, infinite loops, casting issues, etc.)
none!

3. What I needed to search or review:
 (Documentation, examples, lecture slides, etc.)
 nothing.


4. AI Usage (if any):
 - Did you use AI tools? If yes, explain how.
 - Did you verify the output?
none!

5. What I learned:
 (Be specific about loops, counters, casting, etc.)
I did not really learn anything new, just got some practice with if else statements.
