        if (i == 3){
            continue;

/*
Reflection:
1. What I understood from this program:
 (Explain the concept in your own words.)
counts from 1 2 3 4 5 but skips 3 and stops when it reaches 6.
2. Difficulties I faced:
 (Syntax, logic errors, infinite loops, casting issues, etc.)
I did not know what the continue statement was used for, until I found information on the slides.

3. What I needed to search or review:
 (Documentation, examples, lecture slides, etc.)
 I needed to review the slides for the continue statement.

4. AI Usage (if any):
 - Did you use AI tools? If yes, explain how.
 - Did you verify the output?
none!

5. What I learned:
 (Be specific about loops, counters, casting, etc.)
I learned what the continue statement does.
