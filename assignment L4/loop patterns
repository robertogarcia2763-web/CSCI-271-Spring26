    int counter = 1;

    while (counter <= 10) {
        int grade;

/*
Reflection:
1. What I understood from this program:
 (Explain the concept in your own words.)
 The program adds up all of the grades and calculates the average. I understood the counter that makes it so that 10 entries are required to add the total.

2. Difficulties I faced:
 (Syntax, logic errors, infinite loops, casting issues, etc.)
 Compiler errors. I had to modify my tasks.json file. I am using visual studio code.

3. What I needed to search or review:
 (Documentation, examples, lecture slides, etc.)
 what counter++ does.

4. AI Usage (if any):
 - Did you use AI tools? If yes, explain how.
 - Did you verify the output?
none!

5. What I learned:
 (Be specific about loops, counters, casting, etc.)
 I learned how the counter works.
